# erosion_simulation
real-time erosion simulation using procedural programming

Erosion simulation on procedurally generated terrain. Built using Unity, written in C# and HLSL.

Simulating erosion due to water and heat on landscape, generating the eroded landscape.
Uses compute shaders to achieve GPU parallelization. Runs at interactive framerates (40-50 fps).
Generates realistic landscape features such as river valleys, mountain ridges and flood valleys.
Currently uses a simple mesh and texture generator, to be updated.
